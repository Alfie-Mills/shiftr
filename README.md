# Shiftr

This theme has been the work of many years of learning, testing and a hell of alot of passion. Shiftr is a mouldable foundation for any Wordpress project, with performance and accessibility built right into the heart.


## Effortless Development

With less than 1 year in industry at the time, I had enough exposure to see what the most common tasks were. Functions and classes have been designed to tackle these common tasks. Setting up custom post types, adding a post featured image, adding an inline SVG or adding an image via an Advanced Custom Field Image field... Just a selection of the tasks where Shiftr does the heavy lifting.


## SEO ready

After 1 year in a Developer role within an SEO team at a digital marketing agency, an exposure to the SEO world has inspired a majority of the decisions that have gone into this project. The theme is designed to provide the best possible performance and accessibility is being improved around the clock.


## Contact Form Ready

Almost a project in itself, Shiftr has full build-in support for forms. This includes styling, validation, submission and data storage. 


## Trivial

The theme started life in early 2018 named "Project Dawn". A CSS and JavaScript toolkit that was intended to be used in place of any frameworks. The idea was simple, do away with overriding large CSS frameworks and instead write directly into the SCSS files. Making the code lighter and easier to work with. I also wanted to extend this to ditching jQuery, although Dawn was never made it to be jQuery free. The theme was created a final year project whilst studying Digital Media at the University of Portmouth.

It was over a year later that I wanted to push this project further, alot further. This meant completely recreating the structure and adopting a new identity. So born was Shape Shiftr. The idea of the name is that the theme is designed to be shaped around the requirements of a project, rather that leaving redundant code sitting in the corner or dumping plugins that are overkill onto a site.
