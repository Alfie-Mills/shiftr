# What is this directory?


This will be the home for all the Advanced Custom Field groups of your project.

Don't exclude them from your repo as these files allow you to easily sync ACF across environments when you cannot push the database. For instance, if you were to add/update fields on a lcoal environment, you can deploy the repo to your staging/production environment allowing you to sync those new fields on whichever environment you deployed them to!
