# Changelog


## v1.3.1
*17/07/20*

* Introducing Fluid TypographyðŸ¥³ All headings and body font sizes are now controlled using `clamp()`, with basic fallback where not supported.
* Big cleanup of the Posts templates
* The margin of all headings and other type elements has been adjusted to fit harmoniously together in `.content`, `.block-heading` and `.block-after`. We have also combined these three elements to share all major styling of their decendants for improved consistency.
* 404 template has been revamped. It is simpler to control and includes some placeholder notice for admins to see, which instructs them how to add content to the 404 page.

#### Minor updates
* Bug fixes!!
* Sourcemaps excluded from VS Code search
* Login page is more inline with standard WP, only basic styling enhancements remain


## v1.3
*10/07/20*

* JavaScript based components have been re-written as ES6 classes and utilize modern syntax such as destructuring.
* The `Floater` and `Follower` components have been removed due to in-frequent use. `Floater` has been dropped in favour of the css property `position: static`.
* The JS codebase has been been neatened up, with great improvements to the `Carousel`.
* The source assets directory has been renamed from `build` to `src`. We felt the naming was a better suit, as build can be viewed as the directory holding the production assets.
* The Inventory has been removed. We have decided to keep this private in-house for the time being.

#### Minor updates
* Styling updates to the `.site-header`
* Shiftr built-in cookie has been renamed to `shiftr_accept_cookie`
* Shortcuts has been removed for both front and backend
* Some minor bug fixes


## v1.2.2
*07/07/20*

**Bug fixes:**
* `Undefined variable: update_return in inc/shiftr-form.php on line 314` now resolved
* Admin notice is now displayed when updating the Form settings

**Other:**
* The Shiftr logo has been removed frmo the login screen. Felt it was best to keep it more standard with the WP logo.
* The before and after hooks to the Form capture method have been updated to use the form instance as the arg. The `$data` variable itself is now passed to the `shiftr_form_handler_capture_after` hook to amke life easier.


## v1.2.1
*26/06/20*

* **Bug fix:** The form name was not being found in Forms > Data in admin. Well, that has been resolved!


## v1.2
*19/06/20*

* Webpack has been added to Gulp. All JavaScript files have been converted to work on an export/import basis, giving total flexibility as to what is included in the site assets.
* **New feature:** Native Lazy Loading is here! A new class is dedicated to handling the lazy loading on the site. There is also the option in Shiftr settings to disable the lazy loading should it be needed to for whatever reason.
* **New feature:** Flexi Blocks Builder template has finally made its way into the theme as a pre-loaded template. The current starter blocks are: Content, Content & Image and Accordion. More are to follow in the future releases. The template has been very popular and become very simple to work with, so we've put in a real solid foundation to start on going forward.

#### Minor updates
* Accessibility improvements, mainly in the header and navigation.
* API samples for Mailchimp and Instagram are now in the Inventory
* Form submission behaviour has been improved, now the submit button is disabled on click to prevent dual submissions. There is also a clear sending indication when submit button clicked.
* Use of the `backdrop-filter` property has been updated on the header to include `saturate()` and also we use the non-prefixed declaration has support has improved since first added to the theme.
* Scripts are now properly registered via `wp_register_script()`. Such a minor thing, just want to make sure we follow correct practices.


## v1.1.1
*12/06/20*

* Corrected theme version in package.json to v1.1.0
* Cookie notice styling has been moved into main css bundle. Lighthouse was asking a few times to preconnect to the resource which was annoying. It also makes more sense logically to include the styling in the main bundle as it will always have to be downloaded anyway on initial user visit.


## v1.1
*12/06/20*

Major overhaul of the task runner processes. The Gulpfile has been completely rebuilt from the ground up and now uses Gulp v4. The functionality of the tasks remains the same, just rebuilt to work faster and more efficiently. Any previously known bugs have now been resolved, such as JS errors crashing watch, and CSS stops injecting changes after a JS change in the same watch session.

Task names have also been updated.
`watch` Previously `build`, watches for file changes and either injects changes or reloads page. 
`build` Previously `compile-production`, compiles CSS and JS assets for production, minification and comments stripped.
`build-dev` Previously just the standard `compile` task, although not to be used in the CD process, it gives the option to compile assets without building them for production or running watch.

`gulp-environments` has been dropped in favour of using `env.process.NODE_ENV` as it reduces dependancies.

Overall, not all the same packages are used in this update, as some were not needed, or other were replaced with ones that seemed to be better or were more of a package. For instance, `gulp-clean-css` will minify and strip comments.

> The following update has been completed and tested against node v12.18.0 and npm v6.14.4



## v1.0.8
*12/06/20*

* Cookie notice accessibility improvements. The "Accept" and "Learn more" links are now more descriptive to assistive technologies.



## v1.0.7
*18/05/20*

* Removed VS Code tasks from theme, instead tasks is used in the [WordPress Enhanced Workflow](https://github.com/jackson-lewis/wordpress-enhanced-workflow). It is probably more convenient and makes more sense for tasks to be managed by the project workflow instead of the theme.
